The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

That data is available from the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

### Change Log

* 2021-09-06: The data file was originally downloaded for analysis.
* 2021-09-20: a new version of the data was downloaded, and I also
worked to refactor the code to be more general and to allow for my state to be
subset from the larger file.
