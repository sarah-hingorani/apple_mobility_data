# script goal: use the "dplyr" package to count up the number of cities and
# counties in a given state that have detailed Apple mobility data available
# and then eventually save it to a csv

# load the "dplyr" package
library("dplyr")

# we would like to get a count of the number of cities and the number of
# counties in a given state that have driving mobility data. The input to this
# will be the output of the previous script, namely the state csv files that
# were already subsetted.

# load in the dataset from the previous script
input_file_name <- "output/applemobilitytrends-2021-09-18_California.csv"
state_data <- read.csv(input_file_name)

# starting off with dplyr chains
count_cities_counties_by_type <- state_data %>%
  select(geo_type, region, transportation_type) %>%
  group_by(geo_type, transportation_type) %>%
  tally()


# write out the result of the dplyr chain
write.csv(count_cities_counties_by_type,
          "output/california_cities_counties_counts.csv")
